# stocksReminder
A c# project, for managing your stock buyings.\
It sends a weekly recap for all your stocks.\
For each stock we generate a graph, that shows the progress of the stock compared to the Nasdaq-100.\
and calculates the revenue for each stock.

### Weekly reminder example:

## How it works:
Every execution, the program reads from the [users.json](/stocksReminder/bin/Debug/users.json)
